<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Railways were introduced in India in 1853 and as their development progressed through to the twentieth century,<br>several company managed and systems grew up. To enforce standardization and co-ordination amongst various railway<br> systems, the Indian Railway Conference Association (IRCA) was set up in 1903, followed by the Central<br> Standards Office (CSO) in 1930, for preparation of designs, standards and specifications. However, till independence,<br> most of the designs and manufacture of railway equipments was entrusted to foreign consultants. With Independence<br> and the resultant phenomenal increase in country’s industrial and economic activity, which increased<br> the demand of rail transportation - a new organisation called Railway Testing and Research Centre (RTRC)<br> was setup in 1952 at Lucknow, for testing and conducting applied research for development of railway rolling<br> stock, permanent way etc.</p>




<p>Central Standards Office (CSO) and the Railway Testing and Research Centre (RTRC)<br> were integrated into a single unit named Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) in 1957,<br> under Ministry of Railways at Lucknow.
The status of RDSO has been changed from an ’Attached Office’ to<br> ’Zonal Railway’ since 01.01.2003.</p>
