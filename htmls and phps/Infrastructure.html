<p>RDSO has a number of laboratories which are well equipped with research and testing facilities for development, <br>testing and design evaluation of various railway related equipments and materials.Some of these are: 
</p>




<p>Air Brake Laboratory is equipped with facilities for simulating operation of air brakes on freight trains up to 192 <br>wagons and 3 locomotives as also for simulation of passenger trains up to 30 coaches.</p>
<p>
Brake Dynamometer Laboratory has facilities to develop and test brake friction materials for locomotives, coaches and <br>wagons. A unique facility in India , this laboratory has also been used by R&D organisations of Ministry of <br>Defence like DMRL, DRDL and HAL for indigenisation of brake pads for defence aircraft.
</p>
<p>

B&S Laboratory has a 6mx14m heavy/testing floor on which full scale models of beam (spans up to 10 m, slabs, columns, <br>towers, shells and other components made of concrete, steel, brick etc can be tested under static, dynamic or <br>pulsating loads. A high frequency ranging 250-700 cycles/min pulsator for the application of a pulsating loads <br>varying from 2 to 20 tones and a maximum static load of 40 tonnnes on heavy duty testing floor. The Laboratory is <br>equipped with? analogue strain indicator, multi channel dynamic strain recording system, switching & balancing <br>units, acoustic emission equipment, data acquisition system etc. for recording various parameters. 
</p>

<p>
Diesel Engine Development Laboratory has four test beds capable of testing diesel engines from 100 to 6000 HP with <br>fully computerized systems for recording of over 128 test parameters at a time. This facility has already enabled <br>RDSO to develop technologies for improving fuel efficiency, reliability and availability of diesel engines as well <br>as to extract higher output from existing diesel engines. Fatigue Testing Laboratory for testing prototype <br>locomotive and rolling stock bogies, springs and other railway equipments subjected to stress and fatigue so as to <br>ascertain their expected life in service.  Geo-technical Engineering Laboratoryis equipped with facilities for <br>determining strength parameters of soil in lab and field condition. The State-of-art Sub-surface Interface Radar <br>(SIR) system, Laser based soil particle analyser, and computerized consolidation test apparatus have been <br>installed in the lab. The lab also has computerised Static Triaxial Shear apparatus for determining the strength <br>of soil as well as the design of embankment. Metallurgical & Chemical Laboratory is capable of destructive and <br>non-destructive testing of metals, polymers, composites, petroleum products and paints for providing information <br>to be used in design and also for monitoring performance of materials in service.  
</p>

<p>
The M&C laboratory include Scanning Electron Microscope, Direct reading spectrometer, Ultrasonic Flaw Detector and <br>other non destructive examination equipment, polymer and composite evaluation facilities, thermal analyser, <br>corrosion engineering evaluation facilities including weather meter, static 760 hour AR test rig for grease <br>testing. V2F dynamic test rig for grease testing, lube oil filter evaluation rig Cetane rating machine & 50t <br>machine for rubber deflection characteristics.
<p>

Psycho-Technical Laboratory for assessment of critical psycho-physical attributes of operational staff such as <br>drivers, switchmen and station masters for efficient operation. The ergonomic laboratory of psycho-technical Dte <br>is also equipped with bio-feedback system for assessment of EMG, GSR (Galvanic Skin Resistance) temperature, pulse <br>and respiration rate & is used for stress management exercises.
</p>
<p>
Signal Testing Laboratory for testing of all types of signalling equipments such as safety signalling relays, block <br>instruments, power supply equipments, point machines, signalling cables, electro-mechanical signalling equipments/ <br>components etc. There is an exclusive environmental testing section equipped with environmental testing facilities <br>as per ISO:9000. These include, programmable heat, humidity & cold chambers, mould growth, dust, rain chambers. <br>Signalling Equipment Development Centre has been set up in the Signaling Lab. In this Centre, working signaling <br>equipment & systems have been set up. The working systems include SSI, universal axle counter, VLSI axle counter, <br>AFTCs, block instruments etc. In addition, equipment developed by RDSO, such as signalling relays, poly-carbonate <br>lenses, LED signal lamps, triple pole double filament lamps, power supply equipment etc., have also been <br>displayed. This centre will be used for testing minor improvements in designs of SSI, axle counters etc., as well <br>as for imparting training to newly inducted Inspectors. Track Laboratory for testing full scale track panel under <br>dynamic load patterns similar to those encountered in service Stresses at the various locations of track <br>components under simulated load conditions are measured and recorded for analysis. This has helped in <br>rationalising and optimising design of track structures for Indian conditions. The facility of fatigue testing of <br>welded rail joints is also available. n connection with joint research project of UIC on rail defect management, <br>RDSO has been entrusted with lab testing of rail samples from various world railways under simulated loading <br>conditions. Special rail tensioning system for application of longitudinal forces on rail samples to simulate the <br>thermal forces of the field has indigenously been developed, installed and commissioned in track lab. This system, <br>with capacity of up to 150 tonne in static condition, is being used to conduct testing of different rail samples. 
</p>
<p>
Mobile Test Facilities for recording of track parameters, locomotive power and conducting oscillograph trials for <br>evaluating vehicle-track interaction as also for monitoring track conditions. For condition monitoring of OHE <br>under live line and to facilitate directed maintenance of electrification, a Network of testing and recording <br>apparatus (NETRA) car, first of its kind , developed by RDSO is actively in service for scanning OHE in Railway.
</p>
<p>Vehicle Characterisation Laboratory for conducting vehicle characterisation tests on railway vehicles to study the <br>behaviour of suspension systems and to determine natural frequencies Centre for Advanced Maintenance Technology at <br>Gwalior for upgrading maintenance technologies, and methodologies. Also to achieve improvements in productivity <br>and performance of all railway assets and manpower. This covers reliability, availability, utilisation and <br>efficiency</p>
